Acquire a large flat surface like a table or a counter
Sit or stand in front of it 
Mentally imagine there is a 4x13 grid on the table 
Now, mentally assign each column with a number. Start with column one being number one and so on until column ten. Once you get to column ten the final three columns will be Jack, Queen, King. 
Again mentally, assign each row with a suite. The top row will be hearts, the second diamonds then spades and finally clubs. 
Finally, take one card at a time off the top of the deck and place it in the correct column and row based on its suite and number until you have filled your mental grid and have no cards left unorganized. 
(Optional) Place your hand randomly on top of the large group of cards and rub it around until you are satisfied with your destruction of the well organized grid. 
(Or) Collapse each row by stacking one card on top of another so that you have four stacks of cards 1-13 of the same suited
(Or) Collapse each column by stacking one card on top of another so that you have 13 stacks of four cards of the same value

I donâ€™t believe I am missing any essential information, my method is perfect. 
To be efficient means to do something in the fastest way possible without experiencing consistent or built in errors. And to do this you have to find the fastest way possible to do something. So if you are doing something for the first or second time (or third or fourth) being efficient means to find the fastest way to do something as fast as you can while simultaneously making sure that your method does not have any built in errors. 
You can verify the cards are sorted by simply looking at the massive grid and counting and seeing that all the colors match up.
